<h3>How to search BioStudies database</h3>

<p>Use the Search box available in the top-right corner of every page. Enter any words that
    describe studies
    you are interested in. As you start typing, a drop-down list will appear suggesting terms that match.
    For terms that are in <a href="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/efo" target="_blank">EFO</a>
    (<a href="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/efo" target="_blank">Experimental Factor Ontology</a> - an EMBL-EBI
    resource providing systematic
    descriptions of biological samples and experimental variables), a button will be provided enabling
    expansion of more specific terms. Search terms are retained in the search box, where they can be refined
    (see the <a href="#advancedsearch">Advanced search</a> section below).</p>

<p>The search results page is a list of matching biostudies sorted according to relevance.
    You can also change the sorting by using the <i>Sort by</i> selector. If there are many results,
    they will be split over multiple pages. Links at the top of the results allow you to change the number
    of studies displayed per page as well as the current result page. Clicking on the title of a study
    takes you to a more detailed page about that study.</p>

<p>Within the results any matching terms are highlighted.
    <span class="highlight">Yellow</span> highlighting indicates
    exact matches, <span class="synonym">green</span> highlighting indicates synonyms,
    and <span class="efo">peach</span> highlighting indicates more specific
    matches (e.g. "carcinoma" as a more specific term for "cancer"). These more specific terms are from EFO.
</p>

<h3 id="advancedsearch">Advanced search</h3>

<p>Each word in the query is treated as a separate term (unless surrounded by double
    quotes), and by default
    every result has to contain all the terms. This behaviour can be modified by using boolean operators and
    brackets; e.g., Leukemia AND ( mouse OR human ), or cancer AND NOT ( human ).</p>

<p>Queries containing star or question mark characters are treated separately. A star
    character will match
    any combination of zero or more characters, e.g., leuk*mia will match to leukemia and leukaemia, as well
    as leukqwertymia. A question mark character will match any single characters, e.g., m?n will match both
    man and men. Queries that include wildcards are not expanded.</p>

<p>BioStudies search supports regular expression searched, e.g., searching for /[dl]ouse/ gives results for both
    louse and douse). As a results, the some characters (more specifically <span class="mono">+ - && || ! ( )
                { } [ ] ^ " ~ * ? : \ /</span> ) are part of the query syntax and need to be either
    escaped or quoted if entered as a part of your query, e.g., query for eeg/fmri should be entered as either
    eeg\/fmri or "eeg/fmri". Similarly,queries for a DOI should be entered in double quotea as well, e.g.,
    "10.1371/journal.pone.0127346".
</p>

<h3 id="download">How to download public studies</h3>
<p> In addition to file download from the BioStudies website, we also support FTP and Aspera based downloads. In
    both cases you will need to know the location of the files belonging to a particular study. We partition data first by
    the pipeline, such as <span class="mono">S-EPMC</span> for data imported from EuropePMC, <span class="mono">S-BSST</span> for data submitted via BioStudies
    Submission Tool, or <span class="mono">S-DIXA-</span> for data belonging to the ‘diXa’ toxicogenomics data collection. The next
    partition level is by the last 3 digits of the study accession number. E.g., all EuropePMC studies with
    accession numbers ending on <span class="mono">001</span> will be in the folder <span class="mono">S-EPMC/S-EPMCxxx001</span>. So, if the study you want to
    access is <span class="mono">S-EPMC521001</span>, the path will be <span class="mono">S-EPMC/S-EPMCxxx001/S-EPMC521001</span>. If there are less than 3 digits
    in an accession number, e.g., <span class="mono">S-BSST12</span>, the directory will be <span class="mono">S-BSST/S-BSST0-99/S-BSST12</span>.</p>

<h4>FTP downloads</h4>
<p>The FTP server is <span class="mono">ftp.biostudies.ebi.ac.uk</span>; anonymous downloads are enabled. You can explore access through
    FTP via your web browser, e.g., <a target="_blank" href="ftp://ftp.biostudies.ebi.ac.uk/pub/S-BSST/S-BSST0-99/S-BSST12">
        <span class="mono">ftp://ftp.biostudies.ebi.ac.uk/pub/S-BSST/S-BSST0-99/S-BSST12</span></a>. Use any FTP
    client such as FileZilla, or issue FTP commands via a command line, e.g.,
    <span class="mono">wget ftp://ftp.biostudies.ebi.ac.uk/pub/S-BSST/S-BSST0-99/S-BSST12/aeipf_denoised_reads.fna</span>
    or, for interactive access:
<pre class="pre">
        ftp ftp.biostudies.ebi.ac.uk
        Name: anonymous
        Password: enter your e-mail address
        ftp> cd pub/S-BSST/S-BSST0-99/S-BSST12
        ftp> get aeipf_denoised_reads.fna
        </pre>
</p>

<h4>Aspera downloads</h4>
<p>Aspera <span class="mono">ascp</span> command line client can be downloaded here:
    <a href="http://www.asperasoft.com/downloads/connect" target="_blank">http://www.asperasoft.com/downloads/connect</a>. Please
    select the correct operating system. The ascp command line client is distributed as part of the ‘Aspera
    connect’ high-performance transfer browser plug-in.
    Your command for download should be like this:
<pre>ascp -P33001 -i &lt;aspera key&gt; bsaspera@fasp-beta.ebi.ac.uk:&lt;files to download&gt; &lt;download location on your machine&gt;</pre>
where
<ul>
    <li>P33001 and <span class="mono">bsaspera@fasp-beta.ebi.ac.uk</span> defines the server, port and user for Aspera connection</li>
    <li>Aspera key (<span class="mono">asperaweb_id_dsa.openssh</span>) is the public key for Aspera connection.
        &lt;aspera key&gt; might be:
        <ul>
            <li>on Linux: <span class="mono">&lt;aspera connect installation directory&gt;/etc/asperaweb_id_dsa.openssh</span></li>
            <li>on Mac OSX: <span class="mono">&lt;aspera connect installation directory&gt;/asperaweb_id_dsa.openssh</span></li>
            <li>on Windows: <span class="mono">"%userprofile%\AppData\Local\Programs\Aspera\Aspera Connect\etc\asperaweb_id_dsa.openssh"</span> for
                if Aspera Connect has been installed only for the current user or
                <span class="mono">"%programfiles(x86)%\Aspera\Aspera Connect\etc\asperaweb_id_dsa.openssh"</span>
                if Aspera Connect has been installed for all users</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li><span class="mono">&lt;files to download&gt;</span> might be all files for a certain study, as explained above.
        Please note that Aspera paths do not need to have <span class="mono">pub</span> as the root folder.</li>
</ul>

For instance, here's the command line to download the file <span class="mono">aeipf_denoised_reads.fna</span> from submission <span class="mono">S-BSST12</span> to the directory <span class="mono">C:\Temp</span> on Windows.
<pre class="pre">
            "%userprofile%\AppData\Local\Programs\Aspera\Aspera Connect\bin\ascp.exe" -P33001  -i "%userprofile%\AppData\Local\Programs\Aspera\Aspera Connect\etc\asperaweb_id_dsa.openssh" bsaspera@fasp-beta.ebi.ac.uk:/S-BSST/S-BSST0-99/S-BSST12/aeipf_denoised_reads.fna C:\Temp\
        </pre>
